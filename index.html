                          A VPN is a private network that uses public infrastructure (usually the Internet) to connect remote sites or users. A VPN as the name suggests uses a "virtual" connection that is transmitted over the Internet from a private business network to a remote site or remote employee. VPNs originally were created for different resources but getting fame for different reasons these days. Originally they were a way to connect business networks together securely online or to allow you to access a business network at home.

                        <p>
                            VPNs essentially transmit all of your network overload, which benefits such as accessing local network resources remotely exceed online Internet exploration. Most Operating Systems include VPN support. Initially, VPNs were used almost exclusively for business. However, the outbreak of high security breaches that occurred in the early 2000s was a significant moment in the history of VPN technology. With this, daily internet users became aware

                      <p class="mb-4">
                        VPN Tunnels
  The tunnel is actually a virtual pipe. This tunnel makes the actual physical network visible in packets as it is transmitted to the network. In networking there are two types of  tunnels one is permanent and the other is temporary channels. Permanent tunnels, or static, make extensive use of network service. These tunnels are generally considered to be a waste of 7 because they can bind to a maximum amount of bandwidth while not sending too much data. Static pipes can be extremely wasteful, especially in a business environment where they can hardly utilized 24 hours a day.[9]

  Therefore, VPN does not use static pipelines (Kosiur, 1998). A VPN can instead use the most efficient, or dynamic temporary pipelines. These pipelines are considered to be very useful for VPNs because they can be established and removed when needed. These pipelines will not always require resources. Instead, as the VPN application is opened and closed, the pipeline is also built and removed. Due to this Dynamic Allocation the pipe does not require constant bandwidth reservation. This is also considered helpful if the company hires a certain amount of bandwidth usage. Compared with static pipes, temporary pipes significantly reduce the amount of bandwidth used (Erwin, Scott, and Wolfe, 1999). A VPN uses encapsulated Internet packets to move data through this dynamically created tunnel. Encapsulation means that a VPN system wraps a packet with a theme that includes routing details. The package is then sent online throughout. VPN is private because the VPN system first encrypts the packages sent to help ensure data arrives

  safely. After the encryption, packets are encapsulated and shipped to the way passing  through a dynamic tunnel. These two VPN systems L2TP and PPTP, which have been discussed over time, have the potential to use both voluntary and compulsory tunnel classes.

                      <h2 class="tm-color-primary tm-section-title mb-4">VPN Tunneling Protocols</h2>
                      <p>
                        Protocols
                        This section will briefly introduce the different protocols that
                        form the basis of mobile VPN solutions discusssed. 
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        1) Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP): PPP is used to provide a virtual direct link over a multitude of physical mediums between two endpoints allowing encapsulation of network-layer datagrams into frames regardless of the nature of the physical medium. Authentication in PPP is made available via Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) or Challenge-Handshake. Authentication Protocol (CHAP). Encryption can be added by configuring the PPP Encryption Control Protocol (ECP) or by protecting data using a higher-layer  protocol such as IPsec.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        2) Layer 2 Tunneling Protocols (L2TP):
                      There are two main variations of L2TP protocol: L2TPv2 and L2TPv3.
                      L2TPv2 is a data link tunneling protocol which is used to tunnel multiple PPP sessions. Most PPP sessions are distinguished by using the session ID. L2TPv3 can be used to tunnel not only PPP frames but also IP packets. This removes the cap of encapsulating IP packets within PPP frames. Both L2TPv2 and L2TPv3 provide two channels within the tunnel: a reliable control channel and an unreliable data channel. L2TP basically does not provide any security features and it relies on protocols like IPsec for message authentication and encryption.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        3) Generic Routing Encapsulation(GRE):

                        GRE is a protocol used to tunnel an arbitrary network layer protocol across any network protocol. When you encapsulate the X protocol over the Y protocol, GRE takes the package in format X and considers it as a payload package. It starts by encapsulating this packet into the GRE package and then encapsulating this GRE packet into protocol Y, which is considered the delivery protocol.
                        RFC2890 extends  the GRE header to allow the flow of multiple different packets within a single GRE tunnel by packet delivery in-order.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          4) Internet Protocol Security (IPsec):

                          When an IPSec VPN is used, a virtual  "tunnel" connecting the two terminals is constructed. Configure which packets are sensitive. Once configured, the IPSec peer sends the package via tunnel to the remote peer. Internal traffic
                          The VPN tunnel is encrypted so that other public Internet users can’t easily view the intercepted communication. When connected to an IPSec VPN the client computer "virtually" is a full member of the corporate network that is, it is able to see and access the entire network.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                          5)Secure Socket Layer(SSL):

                          SSL VPN (Secure Sockets Layer virtual network) is a VPN method that can be used by the standard Web browser. Contrary to traditional Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) VPN, SSL VPN does not require the installation of specialized client software  on the end user's computer. it is used to give remote users access to the Web
                          Applications, client / server programs and internal network connections.

                          SSL VPN contains one or more VPN devices to which the user connects through his or her Web browser. Traffic between a Web browser and an SSL VPN device is encrypted with SSL protocol or its successor.

                        </p>

<h2 class="tm-color-primary tm-section-title mb-4">VPN Encryption Methodologies</h2>

<p>
  Here, we discuss several VPN encryption techniques. The problem statement, main objectives, and the main idea behind each methodology.
</p>

<p>
<h3>Stream cipher
</h3>
  Stream cipher is one of the plainest methods of encrypting data where each bit of data is encrypted sequentially
  Through one bit of the key. In stream
  cipher, plain data M is modulated by the random key sequence K. The XOR acts as the frequent modulation operation.
  In order to make a stream cipher difficult to crack, one could use a crypto key which varies in length. This would help to cover any recognizable patterns in the resulting ciphered data. In fact, by randomly changing the crypto key used on each bit of data, we can produce ciphered data that is not mathematically possible to crack. This is because using different random keys would not
  generate any repeating patterns which can give a cracker the required clues.
</p>

<p>
  <h3> RC4 Algorithm</h3>
  RC4 is the most widely used stream cipher in software applications. RC4 is a symmetric key algorithm[12]. The exact
  same algorithm is used for both encryption and decryption. It was designed by Ron Rivest in 1987 and kept as a trade secret until it leaked out in 1994. It has a secret internal state which is a permutation of all N = 2n possible n bits words. In this algorithm the key stream is completely independent of the plain text . It uses variable key length and very quick in software; the way in which keys are generated for use as input to RC4 is its
  Problem.

  How Do we Use RC4 in VPN

  The encryption/decryption process as following:
  (i)Create two string arrays,
  (ii)Initiate one array with numbers  ranging from 0 to 255.
  (iii)Fill the second array with the chosen key
  (iv)Randomize the first array depending on the array key array.
  (v) Randomize the first array within
  itself to generate the final key.
  (vi) XOR the final key stream with plain data to be encrypted to generate reconstruct data.
  Threats that RC4 Poses
  A prominent attack on RC4 is a distinguisher attack. It’s goal is to seperate output key stream of RC4 from random key stream. For RC4, such seperators are practically impossible to avoid given a suitably large key
  stream so; the way in which keys are created for use as input to RC4 is its problem. However, in most application this does not cause any security lapses since the actual use of RC4 is not targeted to be secret. RC4 is a very efficient software. However, in hardware RC4 fails to operate fast as in certain applications require high speed dedicated hardware which maight cause problems.

</h2>


  Current VPNs offer a secure, stagnant and stable data connections. A significant drawback that concerns all tested technologies is the loss of performance and throughput, which traces back to the complex encapsulation and authentication techniques. Thus, it appears that adding VPN technologies to existing protocols may cause  additional complexity and high data processing costs. IPSec suffers from complex tunnel negotiation process, raising interoperability problems between different implementations. L2TP do offers data privacy and authenticity if and only if it is combined with IPSec, resulting in excessive data . PPTP is the fastest of the presented
  technologies, slthough its security level is, for critical applications, is not sufficient.


  A new variant of hybrid encryption protocol for VPN data encryption and key management is the VPN server is the trusted authority. The VPN client
  initiates request; the VPN server gives the key value. Using the key value VPN client securely encrypt data with the help of AES-Rijndael. After that,
  the key value encrypted using receivers public key with the help of RSA. Then these values are integrated together and sent to the receiver. The
  receiver using private key and RSA then identify the original key value.Every protocol has its own advantages and disadvantages. If an organisation allows remote access employees, then IPSec based VPN is preferable, but IPSec based VPN doesn’t support roaming in such cases SSL based VPN is optimum preferable.Simulation of wireless LAN for IEEE802.11g protocol has been done, and analyses impact of integrating Virtual Private Network technology to secure the flow of traffic between the client and the server farm
  using OPNET WLAN utility has been carried out. Two Wireless LAN scenarios have been considered
  and the results compared. These are Normal Extension to a wired network and VPN over Extension to a wired network. The results collected
  from the two scenarios, indicate the impact of performance, mainly Response Time and Load, of
  Virtual Private Network over wireless LAN.
